Can`t think of any intro better than this [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGmYCfWyVAM) in Person of Interest series.

I used some files that contain different precision of Pi digits to search for birthdays.

You can set the different precisions of Pi number by a command line argument. 

For example: `python3 bdate_in_pi.py 1000` searches for your birthday in 3 and the first 100 next digits of Pi!
