# π
Several files containing decimals of π and other π-related stuff.

I used these files to search for birthdays in digits of Pi number.

You can set the different precisions of Pi number by a command line argument. For example:

`python3 bdate_in_pi.py 1000` searches for your birthday in 3 and the first 100 next digits of Pi!
